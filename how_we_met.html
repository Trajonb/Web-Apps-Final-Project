                         I remember the night like it was yesterday. I was staying the night at one of my good friend's house, and we were pretty bored. So, we all got the idea to see if
                         anyone wanted to come hang out with us. They knew a lot more people then me so they began to just ask a bunch of different peopel to comeover. Finally, they told
                         me that there was two girls who were going to come and get "lit" with us. I had no idea who these people were, but I just said okay and went along with it. Finally,
                         Zaylie and her friend Kira showed up at my friends home. Zaylie was quite and seemed kind of mean, and I am not the most out going person in the world so I sat quite. I started to 
                         not feel well that night, so I ended up going to sleep early, and never got to say goodbye. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After that night, My friend Myles would still snap Zaylie, so I thought I would talk to the other girl jsut because. However, I was never really interested and nothing was coming of it.
                        Fianlly, after I realized that Myles and Zaylie was not a real thing I decided to add her on snap and talk to her. She would have been my first option, but I did not want to snake my friend.
